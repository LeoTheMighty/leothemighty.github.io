# Welcome to my website

Just a cool place to put some stuff I had been thinking about for a while.

It's time to do some stuff for myself after all, so I figured hey let's work on
that website I've dreaming about for a while now and just say fuck it and make it . yanno ?!

Anyways, you can go look at all PCT photos in the images folder. I know I probably didn't have
to just shove them all in there but lmfao idc. Ur right maybe there are performance issues but I
tried to really choose only the absolute best photos. fuck it fine maybe I'll shove them onto S3
one of these days.
